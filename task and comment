Scheduling in the narrowband Doppler channel

Task:
1. Consider a narrowbnad multipath communication channel with no line-of-sight

2. Consider a slotted wireless channel: a base station sends a data to only one mobile device using a frame of length T The frame length equals to N independent channel uses. Consider an optimal code, that operates at Shannon's limit. Thus, the number of bits transmitted within a single frame is

R=TBlog2(1+S/N)

B=1/Δt⇒R=log2(1+S/N)
2. Consider a base station communicating with multiple mobile devices using time-division multiplexing, when the base-station is able to send a frame to the only mobile device
3. Let the Doppler frequency being small w.r.t. transmittion time
1/T≪fD

Note that the channel realizations between a base station and mobile devices are independent

Please provide the data rate as a function of users count

Professor's comment:
The first comment is to use multiple simulations for any quantity evaluation. 
As soon as your model uses the random input and calculates some characteristics given this random input, your output is also a random variable. 
What is the difference between the Jakes model and the AWGN model? 
In the second case, the channel gain remains constant: the signal attenuation does not depend on time and frequency, and the power amplifier completely compensates for this attenuation. 
As the attenuation does not change with time, the best-channel and the round-robbin show the same results. 
The spectral efficiency is R = log2(1+SNR), where the SNR is constant.
